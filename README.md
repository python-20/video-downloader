# Video Downloader [![Python 3.7x](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/)![](https://travis-ci.com/python-20/video-downloader.svg?branch=master)

Video downloader is a desktop application made with Python. The GUI is built using [PyQT5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/). It allows downloading of Youtube Videos and Playlists to the user's system.

## Future Plans
- [ ] download playlists
- [ ] download from from different 
media sources, such as Reddit, Imgur, GifyCat, and more.

## IMPORTANT ! 
As the original pytube is not being maintained we have made the decision to switch to [pytube3](https://github.com/hbmartin/pytube3)

If you're already using the original pytube, please upgrade using.  

```
pip install pytube3 --upgrade
```

or  

```
pip uninstall pytube
pip install pytube3
```
*_If its a new installation of the project, please ignore this session_*
